                    This website is designed for people with spinal cord injuries to upload data about themselves to a database and allows
                    them to search through the data to find real world answers about spinal cord injury life. The users are required to sign
                    up for the site with registration and it allows them to log in for full access to the secured site. This website uses .NET
                    Core 2.1, SQL, JavaScript, C#, BootStrap and several APIs including Google Maps, Facebook and Sendgrid. This site
                    started as a personal class project, and later was presented to a local non-profit organization that is currently in talks to
                    integrate the project into their organization.

                    <strong>9-Tap Bowling App</strong> - <a href="http://www.9taptour.com/"> http://www.9taptour.com/</a> <br/>
                    This project is a school project for an actual client. This desktop app is written in C# and uses Microsoft SQL Server. The
                    app allows the client to keep track of bowlers that participate in the 9-Tap Tour franchise and stores their membership
                    information along with the scores of every game bowled, money won, handicap, and bonus pin along with some other
                    data. The app also imports the client’s data from the legacy program’s system of Excel spreadsheets, allowing the user’s
                    data from the previous games to be used in the tournaments. Then new entries are made all the calculations are made
                    in the program for the handicap and the bonus pins, and then exports the winner’s data allowing the client to print out
                    the money earned checks directly from Excel, automating the process.

                    <strong>Donkey Cars</strong> - <a href="http://www.donkeycar.com/"> http://www.donkeycar.com/</a><br/>
                    Lead team of fellow students to assemble, set up and test six “Donkey Cars”. This was a project outside of the class
                    curriculum that involved a lot of self-learning and research online. These cars required learning about Raspberry Pi,
                    Python, Artificial intelligence training, networks and a better understanding of following open source projects. This
                    project allowed a great opportunity to learn more about collaborating with others to handle different tasks required of a
                    project.
